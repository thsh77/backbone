# backbone

A clean Hugo theme developed originally for my own homepage

## Installation

If you use git for version control, it's best to add backbone as a
submodule. From the root of your site:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/thsh77/backbone.git themes/backbone
```

## Update

From the root of your site:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
